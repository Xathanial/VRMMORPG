# VRMMORPG
A VR environment


This project is meant for the development of a VR-MMO-RPG (Virtual Reality | Massive Multiplayer Online | Role Play Game)

-With this in mind, we plan to be using neuro tech for the many complicated and numerous stages of development of this game.
The actual game project name is "Spectrum Eternal", and is planned to be used on either a separate console, or already in use (PS4, Xbox One, Standalone PC's)

-The GitHub Repository is meant for file sharing scripts, and for the use of Scripts and data being passed along to other VR Developers in the current project.

-The Theory, algorithems and scripts will be on the Unity Cloud system...
